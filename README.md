About Me: Interview? Gods, this is about the second time that anyone's asked for one.
Anywho! Hello there, most people know me as Arc, one of the Free Paladins that shows
up regularly to the Grindstone, otherwise you'd know of Vernos Hammerworks and the
quality weapons, armors, and tools I craft and sell. I was born and raised in the Shroud,
my Mother and Father still live there with my Half-Brother, Falken, whom I -swear-
signed me up for this! I wasn't the one who put my name down! The jerk's always playing
tricks and I hope he reads this!



Signature Move: "Wings of Interdiction"

The connection to the Divine Magicks is strong within the Paladin, and this is evident in
the dazzling lightshow that Arc can put on at his end of the field. Two brilliant wing-like
formations spread out from Arc's wrists giving him excellent coverage of the goal. Striking
an incoming shot with one of these magical constructions fires the ball back at midfield.
